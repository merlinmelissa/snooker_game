# Snooker Game with P5.js and Matter.js

This project simulates a dynamic snooker game by leveraging p5.js for rendering and Matter.js for physics simulation. The snooker table and balls are designed using p5.js, while Matter.js handles the underlying physics simulation. The collaboration between these two libraries creates a visually appealing and realistic gaming experience. Physics aspects like collision detection, energy conservation, and friction mimic real-world snooker dynamics. Balls bounce off cushions with lifelike responses, and their rolling behavior reflects momentum and drag effects. These subtle yet impactful details enrich gameplay, ensuring players feel immersed in a credible simulation of snooker.

### Intuitive Controls for Enhanced Gameplay:
The app is designed to deliver an engaging and interactive snooker experience by combining mouse-based aiming and cue placement with keyboard-based force adjustment. The mouse is used to position and aim the cue stick, offering precise control over shot direction. The keyboard is utilized to adjust the shot's power, with specific keys mapped to increase or decrease force. This dual-input system adds depth to gameplay, requiring players to strategize and refine their skills.

### Realistic Physics Integration:
The physics simulation powered by Matter.js ensures that every interaction on the table feels authentic. The balls move and collide realistically, with energy transfer and friction accurately modeled. Cushions respond dynamically to ball impacts, adding a level of immersion that mirrors the physical nuances of real-world snooker. The rolling behavior of balls, affected by drag and spin, further enhances the realism. These mechanics are finely tuned to strike a balance between complexity and accessibility, making the game enjoyable for casual players and enthusiasts alike.

### Innovative Rat Obstacle Extension:
An exciting extension to the game is the inclusion of an unique rat obstacle. The rat obstacle appears first after 20 seconds and new ones appear with various sizes and position in a time interval of 20 seconds. This feature introduces a new layer of challenge and unpredictability. The rat appears unpredictably across the table and if the cue ball touches the rat, it deflects, altering its trajectory and creating opportunities for unexpected gameplay outcomes. This obstacle encourages players to aim and time their shots carefully, taking the rat’s position into account. The inclusion of the rat obstacle not only adds humor and personality but also significantly increases the game’s replay value by challenging players in a fun and unconventional way.

### Dynamic Visual and Gameplay Appeal:
The app’s design incorporates gradient effects for the table, creating a realistic and visually pleasing playing surface. Shadowing effects are applied to the balls to give them a sense of depth and dimension, enhancing their lifelike appearance. The cue is meticulously designed to resemble its real-life counterpart, with precise proportions and details. Additionally, the cue's movement is mirrored to real-life mechanics, simulating the experience of playing with an actual snooker cue. This attention to detail ensures that players feel as though they are engaged in an authentic snooker match, elevating the overall immersive quality of the game.
